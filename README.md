Welcome to the Ethereum transaction browsing application!

This simple web application is built using React. It allows you to browse through historical Ethereum transactions and provides the option to hide transactions that have a 0 value. This is currently just a demo and has the potential for many further improvements. 


First, run the development server:

```bash
npm run dev
# or
yarn dev
```

Open [http://localhost:3000](http://localhost:3000) with your browser to see the result.
